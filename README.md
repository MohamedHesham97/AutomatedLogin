# AutomatedLogin
In this project I wrote 1 test case using different frameworks that will check the signin/login function. In all frameworks we will check the negative scenario aka. incorrect input/failed assertions EXCEPT in the BDD framework I will go for the positive scenario providing right email and password so we can have some variety.

PS: The Project name is Sieg1 which means victory/triumph!
